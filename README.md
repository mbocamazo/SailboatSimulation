This Simulator is a project by Michael Bocamazo, started 2014/04/21.  The aim is to construct a decent approximation of the behavior of a 2m long two-sail robotic sailboat. 

Impetus: Model for validation of control logic of Olin Robotic Sailing's Sailbot, and lack of open-source sailboat simulations.

Controls, as of 04/22:
qa - rudder, increment;
zxc - rudder, absolute;
ws, ed - main, jib;
rf - wind heading;
tg - wind speed;
jl - angular velocity;
ik - forward velocity;
arrow keys - direct control of motion, deprecated
